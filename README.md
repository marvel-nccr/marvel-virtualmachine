## What is Quantum Mobile

*Quantum Mobile* is a Virtual Machine for computational materials science.

It comes with a collection of software packages for quantum
mechanical calculations, including

- [Quantum ESPRESSO](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/)
- [Yambo](http://www.yambo-code.org/)
- [fleur](http://www.flapw.de/)
- [Siesta](https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta)
- [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org)
- [Wannier90](http://www.wannier.org)
- [BigDFT](http://www.bigdft.org)

all of which are set up and ready to be used on their own or through the
[AiiDA](http://www.aiida.net) python framework for automated workflows and
provenance tracking.
