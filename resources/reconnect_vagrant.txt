In order to connect vagrant to a new VM in Virtualbox, use ./reconnect_vagrant.sh

### Old instructions

1. Get uuid of machine from: vboxmanage list vms
2. echo "<the-uuid>" > .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/id

If 'vagrant ssh' now does not connect to the new machine,
vagrant may have already deleted the
.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox 
folder which contains, amongst other things, the private key.

3. cp ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/
4. Generate the corresponding public key
   ssh-keygen -y -f  ~/.vagrant.d/private_key
5. Use the Virtualbox GUI to paste the public key inside the VM:
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
