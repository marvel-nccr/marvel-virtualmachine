# Read/write timings
 * write QM image to USB stick 1: 1015s 
   (that's an abysmal write rate of 4.6 MByte/s) 
 * copy QM image from USB stick 1: 182s
   (that's the 25 MByte/s maximum of USB 2.0)
 * download QM image from object store via 802.11ac home wifi: 310s
   (hardware would allow for >500 Mbit/s; effective speed was just 120 Mbit/s)

# Virtualbox timings
 * import QM image from hard disk: 87s
 * import QM image from USB stick 1: 180s
   (i.e. = the read time, plus/minus
