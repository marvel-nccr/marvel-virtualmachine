## Installation / start-up

### Downloading over an instable network

If your network connection is unstable or very slow and you are unable to download the Quantum Mobile image in one go, consider using a download manager that can resume downloads, [such as the `curl` / `wget` command line utilities](https://superuser.com/a/529951/345438).

### Importing the VM results in an error: `NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG (0x80070057)`

This [may indicate that your hard disk is full](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/18343).
Do you have enough disk space to accommodate both the Quantum Mobile image *and* the extracted image (sizes reported in the [installation instructions of the release](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/releases)?

### Running the VM yields an error: `VMDK: Compressed image is corrupted`

Your image file is corrupted - try downloading it again.

You can verify the integrity of the image by computing its md5 hash (`md5sum <filename>`) and comparing the result to the hash provided on the [release page](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/releases).

### Running the VM yields: `VT-x is disabled in the BIOS for all CPU modes (VERR_VMX_MSR_ALL_VMX_DISABLED)`

Enable Virtualization Technology (VTx) and Virtualization Technology Directed I/O (VTd) in your BIOS.

### I start the Quantum Mobile, but I only get a black screen

You probably have VirtualBox version 5. You need VirtualBox 6.x to run Quantum Mobile. Upgrade your VirtualBox and try again.

### Running the VM used to work fine, but recently you start getting errors `RTR3InitEx failed`

The VirtualBox kernel modules do not match this version of VirtualBox.
Executing '/sbin/vboxconfig' may correct this.

The kernel of your host OS may have been updated since the installation of VirtualBox. Follow the instructions above in order to recompile the VirtualBox kernel extensions.

### On Ubuntu hosts, you get an error: `Kernel driver not installed`

Stackoverflow has [some help](https://askubuntu.com/questions/920689/how-to-fix-modprobe-vboxdrv-error-in-virtualbox) on this.

### Installation of VirtualBox fails on macOS High Sierra/Mojave

1. Go to System Preferences => Security & Privacy
2. Click the ‘Allow’ button at the bottom.
3. Re-run the installer.

## Runtime (performance, graphics, ...)

**IMPORTANT** Preliminary tests indicate that VirtualBox 6.1 (released Dec 10th, 2019) addresses at least one of the long-standing graphics issues. Please upgrade.

### In xcrysden (and other software using OpenGL), menus are hidden behind the 3d canvas

Unfortunately, this is an [open VirtualBox issue](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/11596#comment:4). Workaround is to disable 3d acceleration:

1. stop VM
2. Machine => Settings => Display => Untick "Enable 3d acceleration"  

### On macOS hosts, the content of the VirtualBox window stays in place when dragging it using the window bar

Minimize the window and maximize it again.

### On VirtualBox 6, [graphics becomes super slow after a few minutes](https://jsephler.co.uk/slow-laggy-poor-graphics-performance-linux-guest-virtualbox-6-0/)

1. stop VM
2. Machine => Settings => Display => Graphics Controller => Select "VMSVGA"

### VM interrupts WiFi connection and asks for password of `vagrant` user

Password is `vagrant`.

### VM not able to connect to internet on cable connection

(network icon in bottom right corner shows `ADAPTER NAT 1: cable disconnected`)

1. stop VM
2. Machine => Settings => Network => Tick "Cable Connected"
